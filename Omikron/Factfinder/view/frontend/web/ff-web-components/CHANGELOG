# 3.0.0-pre-release-1
This the preview release of our next major update. During the next couple of weeks we are going to upgrade all our internal projects to use our 3.0.0 release.
We expect possible bug fixes during this process but our 3.0 release is feature complete compared to our current version 1.2.13 (31.10.2018). The main difference is that we are now compatible with the current native implementation of Webcomponents and therefore we have a smaller JS bundle and a faster execution.

## New Boilerplate
```html
...
    <script src="../bower_components/ff-web-components/dist/vendor/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"></script>
    <script src="../bower_components/ff-web-components/dist/vendor/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
    <script defer src="../bower_components/ff-web-components/dist/bundle.js"></script>
</head>
```

We already migrated our demos project in the release/3.0 branch: https://github.com/FACT-Finder-Web-Components/demos/tree/release/3.0

## CHANGE
- internal rewrite from [Polymer 1](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview) to [Polymer 3](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview)

## BREAKING
- The way of including the Web Components scripts has changed. See [Installation](https://web-components.fact-finder.de/documentation/install-dist) for the right way to include the scripts
- Aligning with the current trend we no longer support [Bower](https://bower.io/). As a replacement you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- `ff-searchbox`
    - extending built-in HTML elements is not supported anymore. Hence use `<ff-searchbox>` tag with mandatory `<input />` tag inside instead of `<input is="ff-searchbox" />`
    - if you don't want to use the first `input` tag within `<ff-searchbox>`, you can use `SearchBox.resetInput(selector)` to set the input field
- `ff-searchbutton`
    - extending built-in HTML elements is not supported anymore. Hence use `<ff-searchbutton>` tag with mandatory `<button />` tag inside instead of `<button is="ff-searchutton" />`
    - if you don't want to use the first `button` tag within `<ff-searchbutton>`, you can use `SearchButton.resetInput(selector)` to set the button
- `ff-asn-group`
    - use `<div slot="groupCaption" ...>` instead of `<div data-container="groupCaption" ...>`
- `ff-asn-group-element`
    - use `<div slot="selected" ...>` instead of `<div data-selected ...>`
    - use `<div slot="unselected" ...>` instead of `<div data-unselected ...>`
- `ff-asn-group-slider`
    - use `<div slot="groupCaption" ...>` instead of `<div data-container="groupCaption" ...>`
- `ff-slider`
    - use `<div slot="slider1" id="slider1" ...></div>` instead of `<div data-slider="1" ...></div>`
    - use `<div slot="slider2" id="slider2" ...></div>` instead of `<div data-slider="2" ...></div>`
- `ff-carousel`
    - removed `getCurrentSlide` method, use `currentSlide` property directly instead
    - removed `getMaxSlides` method, use `maxSlides` property directly instead

#1.2.13
## ADD
- new element `ff-sortbox-select`
- new element `ff-products-per-page-select`
- new elements `ff-middleware` and `ff-multi-attribute-parsing`. These can be used to configure how multi-attribute fields in the FACT-Finder response shall be parsed in order to access their values more easily. Alternatively, the same configuration is also possible with plain JavaScript. See https://web-components.fact-finder.de/api/ff-middleware#tab=docs for details
- for a better debugging experience `ff-header-navigation` logs now when it hides 2nd layer navigation elements without 3rd layer children. If you want to show 2nd layer navigation without 3rd layer children, you can set the attribute `hide-empty-groups="false"`

## FIX
- `ff-asn-group-slider` does not hide anymore when its `absoluteMinValue` is `0`
- CTRL + click now opens links from elements with `data-redirect` (click tracking) attributes in a new tab
- clicking history back redirects to previous page now when immediate search is on, there is no need to click twice
- in addition to left mouse clicks also CTRL+LMB, SHIFT+LMB and MMB are now tracked on elements with `data-redirect` attribute

## CHANGE
- `query` parameter is no longer included in navigation requests

# 1.2.12
## BREAKING
- new `<a>` elements in `ff-header-navigation` are likely to break styling
- the `navigation` event emitted by `factfinder.communication.ResultDispatcher` now passes an array of navigation elements grouped by `clusterLevel` instead of a flat array of the first level of elements

## ADD
- `ff-header-navigation` now renders `<a>` elements to allow right-click navigation. `href`'s are customizable. Also see breaking changes!
- log warning about improperly used Boolean properties
- `ff-campaign-redirect` now has a Boolean attribute `relative-to-origin` to optionally enable FACT-Finder redirect campaigns to be configured with relative destination urls

## FIX
- the `count` parameter in tracking requests now always defaults to 1 when not provided explicitly
- `ff-campaign-redirect` now immediately redirects preventing rendering of content
- do never provide master ID instead of tracking ID in recommendation click tracking
- fix `ff-onfocus-suggest` component, which wasn't shown due to an internal error
- `ff-campaign-shopping-cart` now respects comma separated values

## CHANGE
- navigation elements passed by the `navigation` event emitted by `factfinder.communication.ResultDispatcher` now have a `__SUB_ELEMENTS__` property containing all immediate child elements
- `ff-communication` registers with the `WebComponentsReady` event to call `factfinder.communication.ResultDispatcher.startDispatching()`. This is necessary due to a change in ff-core which now prevents search responses from going unnoticed by Web Components that are initialized too late. `ff-similar-products` and `ff-recommendation` combatted this behaviour by sending an extra request, which they no longer do
- `ff-communication` search-immediate does now invoke the search much earlier than before. Dispatching occurs on `WebComponentsReady` event.
